#### /.

*main.py*: This file contains functionality to run the experiments. 1.) Pretrain the transfer learning models, 2.) Train and evaluate the models in a few--shot learning scenario. Lastly, you can evaluate all few-shot transfer learning models using Grad-Cam and LIME. 

#### /utils

This folder contains .py files that help loading and preprocessing the data and a constants file, that is used to configure training and evaluation of the transfer learning models and experiments.

#### /data

The data are not pushed into the github repository, to avoid storage overload. 

#### /results

The results are not pushed into the github repository, to avoid storage overload. For some evaluation details look at the Results-Analysis.iypnb.
