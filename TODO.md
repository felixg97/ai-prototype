#### VGG16

[X] DAGM - Source train test
[X] Target train test
[X] Classifiation test

[X] Adapt other transfer learning models

[X] Run DAGM dataset
[] Parallelize GPU settings for different dataset trains (2 is completely unused when just running like this) 
[] Run caltech101 and miniimagenet dataset

### Experimental setup 

[] Programm experiment 10 resample and k-shot (today)
    - save metrics data fram per model and dataset w/ k rows
[] Run experiments for DAGM
[] Run experiments on caltech101 and miniimagenet dataset

[] Early stopping rausmachen f√ºr allerletzten run
